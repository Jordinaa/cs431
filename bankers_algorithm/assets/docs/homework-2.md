# PURPOSE

For this assignment, you will explore deadlocks by solving a programming problem. Demonstrate your understanding of deadlock prevention.

# TASK

Implement the Banker's algorithm to identify potential deadlocks.

(a) You should test your algorithm using the information below:

(b) The algorithm should find a sequence of processes in order of execution to maintain a safe state. For example: the sequence < P1, P3, P4, P2, P0> satisfies safety criteria.

# CRITERIA
