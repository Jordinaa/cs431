# **PURPOSE**
Comparing page replacement algorithms.

# **DESCRIPTION**
Physical memory consists of 4 page frames, initially all empty. The following reference string is processed:  
0 1 4 0 2 3 0 1 0 2 3 4 2 3

# **TASK**
1. Show which pages are resident under the optimal page replacement algorithm. Indicate when page faults happen. _(6 pts)_
2. Show which pages are resident under the FIFO page replacement algorithm. Indicate when page faults happen. _(6 pts)_
3. Show which pages are resident under the LRU page replacement algorithm. Indicate when page faults happen. _(6 pts)_
4. Compare and rank all three algorithms in order of best performance. _(2 pts)_

# **CRITERIA**
**Deliverable:**
- **Please submit a single text file (Word, PDF, or TXT) with all the answers.**
